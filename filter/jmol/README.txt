Jmol/JSmol filter for embedding interactive 3D chemical structures in the Moodle course management system. The master branch uses JSmol, the HTML5/JavaScript version, tested with Moodle 2.3.x and later versions. The MOODLE_2_STABLE branch uses the Jmol Java applet with Moodle 2.0.x and later versions. The MOODLE_19_STABLE branch uses the Jmol Java applet with Moodle 1.9.x and earlier. The Jmol filter was originally written by Dan Stowell.
