This filter takes advantage of the excellent open-source Jmol/JSmol 3D chemical structure visualisation project 

http://jmol.sourceforge.net
 
The filter includes some some basic controls and help files.

This version uses the JSmol JavaScript/HTML5 version of Jmol for maximum cross-platform functionality.
Tested with Firefox 20, Chrome 26, Opera 12, Internet Explorer 10, 9 and 8 (IE 8 defaults to Java applet)

This filter deploys JSmol as a YUI module in order to work with Moodle 2 (tested with Moodle 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 beta)

TO INSTALL:

1. Unpack this .zip or .tar.gz download.
2. Rename the /moodle-filter_jmol folder to /jmol. Copy this /jmol folder (and all its contents) to inside the /filter folder of your Moodle 2.0.x installation i.e. alongside the folders for other filters. Set the permissions of the /jmol folder to be those of the Web server.

Remember to activate the filter in Moodle's filter admin screen. 
Depending on settings, you may need to activate this filter in individual Moodle courses.

Jmol/JSmol is under active development. The latest JSmol version is available from:

http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol.zip

If required, this may be downloaded and and unpacked and the /jsmol folder (and its contents) used to replace the /filter/jmol/yui/jsmol folder
to update to the very latest version.
